SHA-256:
Word lenght = 32bit
2^64 max lenght of input message to convert
returns a digest of 256 bit

dimension of each block = 512 bit

BITWISE OPERATIONS: 
>> and << = are binary bitwise operators used to shift the bits to a specified direction for a number of positions. 
~ = Complement operation on bits.
& = And operation on bits.
| = OR operation on bits.
^ = XOR operation on bits.

TYPES OF VARIABLES:
unsigned type = it doesn't have the bit that identifies the sign, so it can be only positive or zero, BUT NOT NEGATIVE.
uint32_t = Integer of 32 bit (2^32 max value)
uint8_t = unsigned char, used to store a char. A char has a value of 8 bit (that's why its called uint8_t).
