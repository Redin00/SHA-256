# SHA-256 Algorithm

SHA-256 algorithm is a cryptographic function, part of the family of Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA).


## ðŸ›  Simple explanation about SHA-256

SHA-256 is a non-reversable hash algorithm, which uses different types of mathematical functions and bitwise operations to produce a _**unique**_ 256 digest as output.

In the file [SimpleAnnotations](SimpleAnnotations.txt) I wrote some annotations about the code, but to understand it better, I suggest you to read the document about Secure Hash Algorithms provided by the _National Institute of Standards and Technology_: http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf
